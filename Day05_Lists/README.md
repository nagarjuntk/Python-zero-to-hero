# Day 06 – List Operations in Python

Today I practiced basic list operations in Python.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Creating a list
- Accessing elements using index
- Adding elements (append, insert)
- Removing elements (remove, pop)
- Updating list elements
- Finding length of list
- Counting elements
- Reversing a list
- List slicing

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Lists are ordered and mutable.
- Index starts from 0.
- We should not use 'list' as a variable name.
- Lists allow duplicate values.

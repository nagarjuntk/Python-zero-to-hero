# Day 07 – Tuples and Sets in Python

Today I practiced Tuples and Sets in Python.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Tuples
- Creating a tuple
- Accessing elements
- Tuple slicing
- Tuple immutability
- count() and index()

### 🔹 Sets
- Creating a set
- Adding elements
- Removing elements
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Set properties (unordered, unique values)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).
- Sets do not allow duplicate values.
- Sets are unordered.
- Useful for removing duplicates.
- Set operations are important for interview questions.
